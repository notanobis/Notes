If it is also incompressible:

Two causes:
1. Skin friction drag, due to [[Shear stress]]
2. [[Pressure]] drag, due to flow separation also known as   **form drag**
3. [[Induced Drag]] (only for [[Finite wing]])


Blunt body= mostly pressure drag - big regions of flow separation 
streamlined body = mostly friction drag
### Skin Friction
For an [[Airfoil]] the [[Boundary Layer]] starts with Luminar flow and at some point turns into Turbulent flow (both [[Viscous flow]])--> Transition

### Form drag
Flow separation:
1.  Drastic loss of lift --Stalling
2.  Major increase in drag

For luminar flow the flow separation happens much earlier (because the fact that the streamline follows the body is due to friction) and results to much higher form drag than turbulent flow (higher friction inside boundary)
(the total drag is still a function of [[Reynolds number]])
## For [[Airfoil]]:
 $c_d$ , $L'$ 
$$c_d=\frac{D_f+D_p}{q_\infty S}$$
Df= friction drag
Dp= form drag

## For [[Finite wing]]:
 $C_D$ , $L$
$$C_{D,i}=\frac{D_i}{q_\infty S}$$
$$C_D=c_d+C_{D,i}$$
$C_{D,i}$= [[Induced Drag]]
