- Onlu for [[Irrotational flow]]
$$V=\nabla\phi$$
$\phi$ == Velocity potential
with $$u=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$$
...respectively for y and z
differentiating φ to the direction of the velocities gives the flow-field velocities
similar to [[Stream function]] but ψ is differentiated normal to the velocities
- can be applied to 3 dimensions 

A line with constant φ == Equipotential line
$\nabla \phi=const$ == Gradient line == [[Streamlines]]
Equipotential lines are perpendicular to Gradient lines
Meaning
>constant φ lines are perpendicular to to constant ψ lines
