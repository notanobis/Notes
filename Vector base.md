#Math 
Consists of a set of all the linearly independent vectors belonging to that space

### Ορθοκανονική βάση- Orthonormal 
$$(\phi_i,\phi_j)= \delta_{i,j}$$
where δ=[[Kronecker delta]]

### Complete 
Spans the entire space - every other vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the base vectors

#### Components of the vector ψ
**Συνιστώσες**
Each component of ψ is given by the scalar product of ψ with the corresponding base vector
$$a_i=(\phi_i,\psi)$$
