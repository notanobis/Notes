-[[Pressure]] outside the layer is equal to the one on the surface of the body-
-> this only holds for thin layers
We can see the temperature variation inside the boundary in [[Temperature]]

τ [[Shear stress]] and δ (thickness of boundary) are functions of Rex [[Reynolds number]]


### Boundary condition (for [[Inviscid flow]]):
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial s}=0$$
$$\psi_{surface}=\psi_{y=yb}=const$$
where ψ is [[Stream function]] and if constant it indicates a streamline
yb is y of body
s is surface
For φ [[Velocity potential]]:
$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}=0$$
For velocity components:
$$\frac{dy_b}{dx}=(\frac{v}{u})_{surface}$$
