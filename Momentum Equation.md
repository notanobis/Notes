[[Momentum]]
From Newton's second law:
$$F=\frac{dp}{dt}$$
and the derivation of [[Continuity equation]]

From [[Continuity equation]] we derive the equation in terms of [[Substantial derivative]]: 
$$\rho \frac{Du}{Dt}=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}+\rho f+Fx_{viscous}$$
respectively for y and z

For steady inviscid flow with no body forces (f=0):
