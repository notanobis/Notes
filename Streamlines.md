Lines for which , at each point the [[Flow velocity]] is tangential to the curve. For steady streams it is the same with Pathline, but not for unsteady flow.
 
 For [[Irrotational flow]] streamlines are the gradient lines of [[Velocity potential]]

Pathline is the path that a [[fluid element]] traces.

Streamline Equation:
$$dS \times \nabla=0$$

Streamtube: a tube that all of the stream lines pass through  (like a garden hose)

For two-dimensional steady flow:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{v}{u}$$
Solving this differential gives an equation Ïˆ(x,y)=c the [[Stream function]]
