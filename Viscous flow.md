Flow separation: For non slender bodies the thin stream separates from the body (and boundary layer) and forms a wake (eddy).  --> large increase in [[Drag]] (form drag)
~CD proportional to 1/wake size~

The [[Shear stress]]  plays no role away from the body -- for small [[Flow velocity]] gradients (outer region)
Outer region == [[Inviscid flow]]
[[Boundary Layer]] == Viscous flow


1. Laminar flow : Smooth and regular streamlines
2. Turbulent flow : random, irregular- streamlines break

At the surface  y=0 the shear stress:
 $$\tau w(luminar) < \tau w(turbulent )$$
 Same goes for [[Temperature]] and aerodynamic heating
