Dynamic power : when an action is performed
	Does not depend on transistor size
	decreases with each generation
Static power : consumes power when not running code
	Reason: cmos transistors are analog not digital(the current does not reach 0)
	Subthreashhold leakage power-> increases exponentially with temperature and with the dicrease of threashhold V.
	increases exponentially with each generation

Power saving techniques
Activity factor (dynamic increase)
V threashhold 

1. Abstraction level 
2. Time (design time- run time)
3. Effect in latency


Dynamic cache power reduction
- guess the way
- squish the data

Moore's law
- double transistors
- smaller transistor-> faster transistor (higher frequencies)
But
we do not double performance
power increases
--> reason: threshold voltage  ( we can not reduce Vcc (+-3V) nor Vth)

caches ,multicores = power optimisation
