### Ερμητιανός
An [[Operators]] A is hermitian if it is equal to its [[Hermitian conjugate]]
$$A=A^+$$

- The [[Eigenvalues]] of a hermitian operator are real numbers
- Its [[Eigenfunctions]] of different eigenvalues are orthogonal functions
-  A+B is also hermitian
-  A^n is hermitian 
-  F(A) is hermitian

#### [[Commutator]] properties
- if [A,B]=0 then AB is also hermitian
- Generally [A,B]=iC, where C hermitian
