#FluidDynamics 
The velocity of an infinitely small [[fluid element]] as it sweeps through a fixed point in space
$\vec{V}$ : has magnitute and direction, unlike [[Temperature]], [[Pressure]], and Density


The gradient of the velocity is physically the time rate of change of the volume of a moving fluid element of fixed mass per unit volume of that element:
$$\nabla \cdot V=\frac{1}{\delta Vol}\frac{D(\delta Vol)}{Dt}$$

Mass flow= Areea x density x component of flow velocity normal to the area
$$ \dot m =rV_nA$$
Mass flux:
$$\frac{\dot m}{A}=rV_n$$
