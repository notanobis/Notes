T of a gas id proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules
$$KE=\frac{3}{2}k*T$$
where KE is the mean kinetic energy

### Aerodynamic heating
Temperature profile:
Heating rate (heating by flow== convective heat transfer):
$$q'w==k\frac{dT}{dy}$$
for y=0 , where $\frac{dT}{dy}$ is temperature gradient and k is [[Thermal conductivity]]
q'> 0 :from the gas to the body
q'< 0 :from the body to the gas
