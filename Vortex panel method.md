It is similar to [[Source panel method]] (zero circulation so it is only used for [[Non-lifting flow over circular cylinder]] and other bodies) .

We use a [[Vortex sheet]] to cover the surface of the [[Airfoil]] in such a way that the body surface becomes a streamline and the [[Kutta-Joukowski theorem]] condition is satisfied

[[Circulation]]
$$\gamma_i=-\gamma_{i-1}$$
$$\Gamma =\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_j s_j$$

[[Lift]] per unit span

$$L'=\rho_\infty V_\infty\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_j s_j$$
