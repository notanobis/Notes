###### A flow that is assumed to involve no friction, thermal conduction, or diffusion is called an inviscid flow

$$Re\to \infty$$
where Re is [[Reynolds number]]

Flow outside the boundary layer is often considered inviscid for slender bodies -->  [[Shear stress]] contributes on drag--> Not a good estimation of drag
