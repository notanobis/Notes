[[Irrotational flow]] and [[Rotational flow]]
ψ= constant designating a streamline =c1 
units= [kg/(s m)]
Δψ= mass flow (per unit depth Δn) between streamlines= c2-c1

From Chain rule:
$$d \psi =\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}dy$$
Where
$$\rho u=\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}$$
and 
$$\rho v=-\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}$$

For [[Incompressible flow]] $\rho$ can be dismissed 

see also [[Velocity potential]]
- can be applied to 2 dimensions only
