### Static pressure
When saying pressure we usually refer to static pressure which is the pressure due to the random movement of the molecules on a certain speed V1

- Measured by the static pressure orifice

### Total pressure
The pressure if we stopped the flow entirely V2=0
When local velocity is 0 the total pressure is the same with static pressure

- Measured by the pilot tube

### Dynamic pressure
$$q=\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2$$
The pressure due to the velocity

### Relation for stagnation point :
$$po=p1+qo$$
Total pressure= Static pressure + Dynamic pressure
(only for [[Incompressible flow]] - derivates from [[Bernouli's Equation]] )

#### Pressure coefficient
[[Dimentionless coefficients]]
$$cp=\frac{p-p_{\infty}}{q_\infty}$$

For [[Incompressible flow]] ( derivation from [[Bernouli's Equation]]) : 
$$C_P= C_P(V)=1-\frac{V}{V_\infty}^2$$
or 
$$p=p_\infty +q_\infty C_p$$

For V=0 : Pressure coefficient at stagnation point: $C_P=1$
