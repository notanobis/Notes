[[Flow velocity]] induced at P from a straight vortex filament (line of little [[Vortex Flow]])
From [[Biot-Savart law]]:
$$V=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi h} $$
where h is the normal distance of the point from the filament

#### Helmholtz's theorem
1. The strength of a vortex filament is constant along its length
2.  It cannot end in fluid. It must extend to infinity or form a closed path
