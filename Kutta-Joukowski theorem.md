[[Circulation]]
$$\Gamma=\oint V\cdot ds$$
The [[Lift]] per unit span on the airfoil is:
$$L'=\rho _\infty V_\infty \Gamma$$

### Circulation Theory
We calculate Γ on a line that contains the airfoil --> we can estimate the lift

#### Conditions for airfoils
 The below conditions are enforced by the viscous [[Boundary Layer]] that stays attached to the foil till the trailing edge (enforced by friction ):
1. For a given airfoil and angle of attack Γ should be such that the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly
2. If the trailing edge angle is finite then it is a [[Stagnation points]]
3. If it is cusped then $V_l$ and $V_u$ should be parallel and equal
