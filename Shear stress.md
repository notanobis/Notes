\The tangential (=εφαπτομενικά) force per unit area

For [[Solids]] : proportional to the amount of deformation
For [[Fluids]] : proportional to the rate of change of the deformation

$$\tau=\lim_{dA \to 0}\frac{dFf}{dA}$$
Magnitude of the frictional force per unit area, where dA is tangential to the streamline and Ff is the force of friction

For [[Aerodynamics]]:
$$\tau=\mu*\frac{dV}{dy}$$
- $\mu(T)$  is the [[Viscosity coefficient ]](=ιξώδες)
- V is [[Flow velocity]]
- dy is the distance between [[Streamlines]]
- $\frac{dV}{dy}$ is the spatial derivative - velocity gradient
