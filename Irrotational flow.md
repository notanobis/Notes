Or ** Potential flows **
$$\xi = \nabla\times V=0$$
Vector identity:
$$\nabla \times(\nabla \phi)=0$$
with $\phi$ a scalar function
Which means
$$V=\nabla\phi$$
$\phi$ == [[Velocity potential]]
-> it allows us to deal with the velocity as one unknown

For irrotational and [[Incompressible flow]]---> [[Lapalace's Equation]]
