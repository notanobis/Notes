1.  H is a [[Linear vector space]]
2.  The scalar product:
-  is not commutative ! (x,y) is the [[Complex Conjugate]] of (y,x)
$$(x,y)=(y,x)*$$
$y \in H$ while $x\in H_d$  dual Hilbert space
- Is linear with respect to the second factor but not to the first
- $$(\psi,\psi)=||\psi||^2>=0$$
where =0 only if ψ=0
3.  H is seperable - There exists a [[Cauchy Sequence]] such that for every ψ there exist a ψn --> $|\psi-\psi_n|<e$
4.  H is complete - Every cauchy sequence converges to an element of H
