A linear [[Vector space]] (V) consists of two sets of elements and two algebraic rules: 
- a set of vectors  and a set of [[Scalar]] 
- a rule for vector addition and a rule for scalar multiplication

The addition rule has the properties and structure of an [[Abelian Group]]
(Είναι αβελιανή ομάδα ως προς την πρόσθαιση)

The multiplication of vectors by scalars (scalars can be real or complex numbers)
a,b = scalars
- if $x,y \in V$  then any linear combination $ax+by \in V$
- [[Distributivity]]  with respect to addition
$a(x+y)=ax+by$
- [[Associativity]] with respect to multiplication of scalars
$(ab)y=a(by)$
- $\exists$  unitary scalar I and a zero scalar O
$Iy=y$ and $Oy=O$

======
1. [[Vector space]]
2. any linear combination also belongs to the space
