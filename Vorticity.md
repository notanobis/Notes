$$\xi= 2\omega=\nabla\times V$$
where ω is the angular velocity
The curl of the velocity is equal to the vorticity

If: 
$\nabla \times V\neq 0$ -->[[ Rotational flow]]
$\nabla \times V=0$ -->[[ Irrotational flow]]

Irrotanional flow in two dimensions conditions:
$$\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0$$

From [[Stokes theorem]]
$$(\nabla \times V)\cdot n=-\frac{d\Gamma}{dS}$$
where Γ is [[Circulation]] and n the vertical vector to a surface
