Replace camber line with [[Vortex sheet]]
Condition: Camber line should be a [[Streamlines]]:

### Fundamental equation of thin airfoil theory
$$\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{c}\frac{\gamma(\xi)d\xi}{x-\xi}=V_\infty(a-\frac{dz}{dx})$$
with the condition $$\gamma(c)=0$$


## Symmetrical thin airfoil 
Chord line = camber line

Moment coefficient on the leading edge:
$$c_m=-\frac{c_l}{4}$$

1. $c_l=2\pi a$
2. Lift slope=2Ï€
3. The aerodynamic center is the quarter chord c/4 : Moment coefficient is zero
The same point is also the pressure center


## Cambered thin airfoil
From [[Fourier Series]]:

[[Circulation]]:
$$\Gamma =cV_\infty (\pi Ao+\frac{\pi}{2}A_1)$$

[[Lift]] per unit span (from [[Kutta-Joukowski theorem]]):
$$L'=\rho_\infty V_\infty ^2 c (\pi Ao+\frac{\pi}{2}A_1)$$

Lift coefficient:
$$c_l=2\pi[a+\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{dz}{dx}(cos\theta_0-1)d\theta_0]$$

Lift slope:
$$\frac{dc_l}{da}=2\pi$$

We can calculate the angle of attack for zero lift L=0:

[[Moment]] on the leading edge:

independant of angle of attack.
The [[Aerodynamic center]] is close to the quarter chord . It is not the same point with the center of pressure.
The center of pressure varies with the lift coefficient.
